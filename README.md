I created a mobile-responsive esports registration website for my friend's college event using PHP, HTML, and CSS. It was deployed on InfinityFree with an SSL certificate to ensure security. I learned how to deploy PHP sites, configure SSL, and optimize for mobile, making the registration process seamless and secure.
