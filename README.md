I developed a mobile-responsive website for my friend's esports competition at his college. The website was built using PHP, HTML, and CSS only, making it lightweight and functional for the competition registration process. The goal was to provide a seamless experience for users registering for the event from their mobile devices.

Key Features:
Mobile-Optimized Design: The website was designed with a focus on mobile users, ensuring that participants could easily access and navigate the registration page from their smartphones.

PHP Backend: The registration system was powered by PHP, which handled form submissions, database interactions (if applicable), and dynamic content generation.

SSL Integration: One of the major challenges I faced was deploying the website with proper security. I successfully obtained an SSL certificate through InfinityFree (a free web hosting service) to ensure the website was secure and that users wouldnâ€™t see any security warnings when visiting the site. This helped build trust with users registering for the competition.

Deployment on InfinityFree: I learned the process of deploying a PHP website on InfinityFree, which provided the necessary server resources to host the site for free. The deployment process involved uploading the files through FTP and configuring the PHP environment.

Smooth User Experience: Throughout the development, I focused on providing an intuitive user experience. The registration process was straightforward, with a clean and user-friendly design that made it easy for participants to sign up for the competition.

Key Learnings:
How to deploy a PHP-based website on a free hosting platform like InfinityFree.
Obtaining and configuring an SSL certificate to ensure secure communication between the users' devices and the server.
Troubleshooting common issues related to mobile optimization, PHP code deployment, and SSL certificates.
The project was a success, and I gained a wealth of knowledge in web development, deployment, and ensuring a secure, mobile-friendly experience for users.
